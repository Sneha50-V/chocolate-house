# Step 1: Navigate to Your Project Directory

Use the cd command to change your directory to the location of your Chocolate House project. For example:

cd C:\Users\91761\OneDrive\Desktop\chocolate1

# Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment, use the following command:

python -m venv env

This command creates a new directory named env in your project folder, which contains the Python interpreter and libraries for your virtual environment.

# Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

.\env\Scripts\activate

After activation, your command prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active, typically showing (env) at the beginning of the line.

# Step 4: Install Required Packages

While in the activated virtual environment, install the necessary packages for your project using pip:

This command will install Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy, which are required for your application to run.

# Step 5: Run the Application

Now that you have installed the required packages, you can run your application. Use the following command:

python app.py

# Step 6: Open Your Browser

Once the application is running, you will see output indicating that the server is running, such as:

Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access your Chocolate House application.
